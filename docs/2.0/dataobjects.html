Title: DataObjects

	<P>DataObjects (Cayenne persistent objects) are composed of attributes and relationships. Attributes are the simplest object properties (as in &quot;java bean properties&quot;) that can be stored in the columns in the database. Those are usually string, numeric, binary or date values. Another type of properties is relationships. They represent related DataObjects (to-one relationships) or collections of DataObjects (to-many relationships). To read and modify attributes and relationships, application code would simply invoke corresponding get or set methods. In case of to-many relationships represented by collections there are also add and remove methods.</P>

<P>Queries discussed in the previous chapter are used to obtain the initial sets of DataObjects. After that a graph of persistent objects is navigated and modified via relationship methods, thus hiding the underlying relational storage complexity and giving application a nice object view of the relevant subset of the database data.</P>

<P>Examples of working with attributes and relationships are given later in this chapter.</P>
