Title: Stored Procedures

	

<P>In addition to mapping database tables and views as entities, Cayenne allows mapping and executing database stored procedures. Just like table structure is described by DbEntities, stored procedures are described by Procedure class. Stored procedures are created using CayenneModeler, and are executed using <A href="http://objectstyle.org/cayenne/api/cayenne/org/objectstyle/cayenne/query/ProcedureQuery.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">ProcedureQuery</A>, as described in the following chapters.</P>
