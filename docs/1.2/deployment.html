Title: Deployment

	

<P>Cayenne application deployment is about configuring the application so that at runtime it can find a main project file (cayenne.xml) and associated resources, such as DataMap and DataNode XML files.</P>

<P>The central point in Cayenne deployment is the <A href="http://objectstyle.org/cayenne/api/cayenne/org/objectstyle/cayenne/conf/Configuration.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Configuration</A> class. It locates and loads all the mapping and configuration information required for Cayenne at runtime. By default Configuration uses a singleton model, i.e. normally there is only one instance of Configuration (or a subclass) that exists in the application. This shared instance can be accessed in the following way:</P>
<DIV class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><DIV class="codeContent panelContent">
<PRE class="code-java"><SPAN class="code-keyword">import</SPAN> org.objectstyle.cayenne.conf.Configuration;
<SPAN class="code-keyword">import</SPAN> org.objectstyle.cayenne.access.DataDomain;
...
Configuration conf = Configuration.getSharedConfiguration();
DataDomain domain = conf.getDomain();
</PRE>
</DIV></DIV>
<P>As discussed in the following chapters Configuration works behind the scenes and users rarely care about it. Application code is normally only concered with obtaining a DataContext.</P>
