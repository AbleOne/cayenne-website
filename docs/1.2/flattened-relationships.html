Title: Flattened Relationships

	

<P>Flattened relationships represent relationship between two types of DataObjects that is not direct in the underlying relational storage. Instead it is mapped across one or more &quot;join&quot; tables. Still from the application point of view there is no diffrence in working with flattened relationships compared to the &quot;normal&quot; ones. Cayenne internally figures out how to build the needed query joins to retrieve related objects. On adding or removing an object to/from a flattened relationship via a corresponding &quot;addTo...&quot; / &quot;removeFrom...&quot; method an appropriate join record is created or removed.</P>

All other types of flattened relationships can be used as &quot;read-only&quot;. This is reflected in the DataObject code generated for such relationships - no set/addTo/RemoveFrom methods are created for read-only relationships.</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV>
