<P>Continuing with the example used for <A href="modeling-single-table-inheritance.html" title="Modeling Single Table Inheritance">single table mapping</A>, let's re-map it as vertical inheritance.</P>

<P><SPAN class="image-wrap" style=""><IMG src="modeling-vertical-inheritance.data/vertical-inheritance.png" style="border: 0px solid black"></SPAN></P>

<P>Note that in Cayenne <B>vertical</B> is essentially <B>single table with flattened attributes in subclasses</B>. We'll demonstrate this below.</P>

<P>We need to start by mapping all 3 tables, and creating 1..1 relationship between BOOK and subclass tables (&quot;To Dep PK&quot; must be checked on BOOK side of relationships).</P>

<P>On the ObjEntity end, there is no difference in mapping qualifier (it is needed), superclass, root table (&quot;Table/View&quot; for subclasses is still &quot;BOOK&quot;). The only difference is that subclass-specific attributes are mapped as &quot;flattened attributes&quot;:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Note that flattened attributes can be used with or without inheritance, however in combination with single-table inheritance mapping, they give us &quot;vertical&quot; inheritance.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
