Title: Comparing DataObjects

	<P>If you have two objects a and b in the same DataContext, then you can check to see if they refer to the same database entity as simply as this:</P>

<P>{{ if (a == b) }}</P>

<P>If the objects are not in the same DataContext then this will not be true.</P>


<P>To compare objects in separate contexts, then you can compare the object ids.</P>

<P>{{ if (a.getObjectId().equals(b.getObjectId()) }}</P>
