Title: Remote Object Persistence Lifecycle Callbacks

	<P><EM>(since 3.0)</EM></P>

<P>The easiest way to add server-side functionality to the web service is by registering <A href="lifecycle-callbacks.html" title="Lifecycle Callbacks">persistent object lifecycle callbacks</A>. Callbacks are enabled by default, so nothing special needs to be done beyond setting up the listeners.</P>
