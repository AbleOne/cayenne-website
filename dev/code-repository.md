title:  Code Repository

Cayenne uses git for source code version control. The authoritative writable repository is located here:

[https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cayenne.git](https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cayenne.git)

This website is also in version control and located here:

[https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cayenne-website.git](https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cayenne-website.git)

You can clone these repositories, or use the GitHub read-only copies:

[https://github.com/apache/cayenne](https://github.com/apache/cayenne)
[https://github.com/apache/cayenne-website](https://github.com/apache/cayenne-website)

Feel free to fork and/or star Cayenne there. You can also make a pull request if you have code to contribute.


## Legacy Subversion Repository

Up to version 3.2M2 we used Subversion. For archival purposes the svn repository is still available in a read-only mode:

[https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/cayenne/main/](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/cayenne/main/)

Note that it contains branches and tags for releases prior to 3.0 that are not present in git. So if you are looking for those older releases, you will have to use svn. The whole commit history of trunk/master was transferred into git.
